# Color-S4L: Self-supervised Semi-supervised learning with image colorization.
## An extended model for image classification in semi-supervised learning.
      
### Abstract

This work addresses the problem of semi-supervised image classification task with the integration of several effective self-supervised pretext tasks. Different from widely-used consistency regularization within semi-supervised learning, we explored a novel self-supervised semi-supervised learning framework (\textbf{Color-$S^{4}L$}) especially with image colorization surrogate task and deeply evaluate performances of more various neural architectures in such special pipeline. Also, we demonstrate its effectiveness and optimal performance on CIFAR-10, SVHN and CIFAR-100 datasets in comparison to previous supervised and semi-supervised methods. 

Continued to update the whole code.
